function example_batch_script()
%Neuritetracker is software for high throughput detection, tracking, and 
%segmentation of neuroblasts and neurites as they migrate in live cell 
%imaging.
%
%This example script demonstrates how to do batch processing of several
%sequences with neuritetracker. It is currently set to run {example_2, 
%example_3} sequences in the TestData folder. Modify it to your needs.
